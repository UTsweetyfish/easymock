Description: Java library to generate Mock Objects for given interfaces

 given interfaces. Mock Objects simulate parts of the behavior of domain code,
 and are able to check whether they are used as defined. Domain classes can be
 tested in isolation by simulating their collaborators with Mock Objects.
